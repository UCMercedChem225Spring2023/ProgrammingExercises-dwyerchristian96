Q1: Complete! See plot_05_Q1 for the plot.

Q2: Complete! See plot_05_Q2 for the plot.

Q3: Complete! See plot_05_Q3 for the plot. Changing the potential from V(x) = 1x to 
    V(x) = 10x caused the vertex of the ground state wavefunction to shift to the 
    left. Since both wavefunctions have a linear potential function, they have a 
    similar shape. As an important note, the V(x) = 1x wavefunction uses 4 basis 
    functions, while the V(x) = 10x wavefunction uses 7 basis functions.

Q4: Complete! See plot_05_Q4 for the plot. Changing the particle mass from m = 1 to 
    m = 10 resulted in significant differences compared to the plot in Q3. First, 
    the V(x) = 1x wavefunction completely overlapped the V(x) = 10x wavefunction in 
    plot_05_Q3. Upon further analysis, this occurred because the first four terms 
    of both wavefunctions had incredibly similar weighted coefficients. Second, the 
    V(x) = 10x wavefunction was the only wavefunction in our analysis to form a 
    potential well. This occurred because the ground state eigenvector contained 
    all negative coefficients. From a physical perspective, setting m = 10 and 
    V(x) = 10x may have resulted in a system that exhibits non-classical behavior 
    due to the effects of the added potential.
